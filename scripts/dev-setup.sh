#
# Shared developer / CI toolchain bootstrap for the andreas-services monorepo.
#
# Installs the cross-cutting tools every service needs (Terraform, tflint, AWS
# CLI, GitHub CLI + its gh-stack extension, Node.js, jq, zip, Stripe CLI) with
# Homebrew on BOTH macOS and Linux. Service-specific
# runtimes live in per-service scripts, e.g. humbugg/scripts/dev-setup.sh (.NET).
#
# Homebrew details:
#   - macOS (developer machines): brew runs as the normal user.
#   - Linux (this cloud sandbox / CI): Homebrew refuses to run as root, so it is
#     installed into the default prefix /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew owned by the
#     non-root `ubuntu` user, and every `brew` call is run as that user via
#     $AS_BREW_USER (`sudo -H -u ubuntu`) — which applies when this script runs
#     as root too, since root is exactly the case Homebrew rejects.
#     The prefix bin is added to PATH (this run + /etc/profile.d) so root and CI
#     agents can execute the installed tools.
#   - terraform and tflint are NOT in homebrew-core; they come from taps
#     (hashicorp/tap, terraform-linters/tap) on every platform.
#
# IDEMPOTENT: every tool is checked with `command -v` before install, so
# re-running is a no-op once the toolchain is present.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/dev-setup.sh            # install everything missing
#   ./scripts/dev-setup.sh --check    # report status only, install nothing
#
