# Humbugg testing — the map

Humbugg's suites follow studio's model: tiers with hard boundaries, one gate per
gated tier, and harnesses that police themselves. Studio's tiers are directories
under one pytest tree; Humbugg's live in four ecosystems (xUnit, Jest, Vitest,
Playwright), so the boundary is a project or a mode rather than a directory — but
the questions "which tier am I in" and "what may I touch" still have one shared
answer, and this file is where it lives.

## The tiers

| Tier | Where | Runs | Talks to | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Backend unit | `backend/Humbugg.Api.Tests/` | every PR | hand-written fakes | — |
| Backend integration | `backend/Humbugg.Api.IntegrationTests/` | **local only, never CI** | real dev-stack AWS | `HUMBUGG_INTEGRATION=1` |
| App unit | `app/src/**/*.test.ts(x)` | every PR | jest-expo mocks | — |
| App browser, stubbed | `app/e2e/*.spec.ts` | every PR | committed fixtures | — |
| App browser, live | same specs | local only | dev backend + dev Cognito | `E2E_LIVE=1` |
| Marketing unit | `marketing/**/*.test.ts(x)` | every PR | jsdom | — |
| Prod smoke | `humbugg-prod.yaml` post-deploy jobs | after deploy | live prod | — |

The prod smoke jobs (the curl assertions over all three surfaces and the SES
mailbox-simulator loop) are a **detector, not a gate**: there is no staging, the
image is already serving, and their unique value is exercising what nothing local
can — the deployed Lambda's own IAM role, CloudFront behaviors, real SES feedback.

## Commands

```bash
# ── PR tier (what CI runs) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
cd humbugg/backend  && dotnet test Humbugg.slnx        # unit + integration-as-skips
cd humbugg/app      && npm test                        # jest
cd humbugg/app      && npm run e2e                     # Playwright, stubbed — no AWS
cd humbugg/app      && npm run a11y:check              # accessible names, read off the source
cd humbugg/marketing && npm test                       # vitest

# ── integration tier (local only) ─────────────────────────────────────────────
humbugg/scripts/dev-test-integration.sh                # THE entry point; exports the flag

# ── browser tier, live (local only) ───────────────────────────────────────────
humbugg/scripts/dev-up.sh                              # backend :5001 + app :8081
cd humbugg/app && npm run e2e:live

# ── re-record the e2e fixtures ────────────────────────────────────────────────
humbugg/scripts/dev-up-backend.sh
cd humbugg/app && npm run e2e:capture
```

## The part that is not a test

Accessibility is checked three ways, because it splits three ways:

| Property | Where | Why there |
|---|---|---|
| An accessible name on every control | `app/tool/accessibility-audit.ts` | decidable from the source, and invisible at runtime — an `aria-label` inside a `FieldLabel` is silently overridden by the design system's `aria-labelledby`, so it looks correct and does nothing |
| Colour contrast | `app/src/theme/contrast.test.ts` | decidable from `brand-colors.json`, so editing a brand colour is what runs it |
| Width, keyboard reach, private data on screen | `app/e2e/verification.spec.ts` | needs a rendered page |

What is left after those three needs a person and a real device — a screen reader, gesture
navigation, the largest text size, a two-account walkthrough of the whole exchange. That is
[`free-verification-checklist.md`](free-verification-checklist.md), and it is short on purpose:
everything a machine could take has been taken off it.

## Where does my test go?

- **A service, the matching engine, email composition, validation** — anything a
  hand-written fake can stand in for → `Humbugg.Api.Tests`. This is the default.
- **A repository's actual DynamoDB behavior** (marshalling, key construction, GSI
  queries, conditional writes, transactions) → `Humbugg.Api.IntegrationTests/Data/`.
  The unit tier fakes at the `I*Repository` interfaces, so everything below them is
  invisible to it — that blind spot is this tier's whole reason to exist.
- **The HTTP pipeline** (auth, CORS, error envelopes, model binding, a full flow
  over real tables) → `Humbugg.Api.IntegrationTests/Http/`, in-process via
  `WebApplicationFactory<Program>`.
- **A screen, context, or util in the app** → colocated `*.test.tsx` under
  `app/src/`. Auth-coupled seams (contexts, session store, redirect) belong here;
  presentational components are exercised more honestly by the browser tier.
- **A user journey in a real browser** → `app/e2e/*.spec.ts` (see
  [`app/e2e/README.md`](../app/e2e/README.md)).
- **Marketing content or links** → colocated `*.test.tsx` in `marketing/`.
- **Only observable on the deployed system** → the post-deploy smoke jobs in
  `humbugg-prod.yaml`.

## What a new test may not do

Each rule traces to a real hazard, most of them already paid for once:

1. **No PR-tier test may touch AWS.** PR workflows never write to AWS (repo rule);
   anything needing real tables goes behind `HUMBUGG_INTEGRATION=1`, and the flag
   is exported in exactly one place — `dev-test-integration.sh`.
2. **No integration test may depend on prod, or on another machine's stack.**
   Configuration comes only from `backend/.env`, written by `dev-aws-setup.sh`
   from the machine-scoped Terraform outputs. `AWS_PROFILE` in that file is
   deliberately ignored by the fixture.
3. **Integration tests write `itest-`-prefixed ids and register cleanup.** The
   dev-stack tables are shared with your local app; `dev-aws-reset.sh` is the
   blunt fallback, not the plan. Reads through a GSI go through `Eventually(...)`
   — a bare read-after-write on an eventually-consistent index is a flake.
4. **No fixture captured with `curl`.** `app/e2e/support/capture-fixtures.mjs`
   scrubs invite secrets and presigned URLs and asserts the scrub held. (Studio
   put a signing key id into git this way; the rule exists so we never do.)
5. **No auth backdoor compiled into the app.** The e2e session is seeded through
   the app's own `humbugg.auth.*` token store; an `if (E2E)` switch in the bundle
   is a production vulnerability wearing a test's clothes.
6. **No module-level skip.** `test.skip(LIVE, …)` at module level skips a whole
   file and reports green having run nothing; skip per-spec (`stubOnly(...)`).
7. **The Metro export for e2e always runs `--clear`.** Metro's transform cache
   does not key on env vars; without it the export silently reuses whichever
   `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` values the previous export inlined (measured: identical bundle
   hash across env changes).
8. **Env-var table names stay cross-checked.** `CiSmokeEnvironmentTests` parses
   `Program.cs` `RequiredTable` literals against the PR workflow's `-e` flags —
   written after three PRs sat red for weeks on the same one-line omission. Add a
   table, expect that test to tell you where else it must appear.

## Coverage

Coverage is **printed and gates on nothing** — in `validate-backend` (MTP
CodeCoverage → cobertura → a line per project in the job log), `build-app`
(`jest --coverage`), and `build-marketing` (`vitest --coverage`). There is no
`fail-under` threshold, deliberately: a number picked before anyone has read a
real one either sits below reality (and means nothing) or fires on unrelated PRs
until somebody deletes it. Read the number, aim work at what it says is dark —
the repository layer was 2,106 uncovered lines for months while the services
above it sat at near-full coverage, and no threshold would have said so.

Note for the backend: `Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.CodeCoverage` must stay on a
version whose `Microsoft.Testing.Platform` dependency matches what xunit.v3
resolves (currently the 1.9.x family — xunit 3.2.2 ships `mtp-v1` assemblies). A
newer coverage package silently upgrades MTP and every extension in the process
fails to load with `TypeLoadException` at run start.
