# THE ONE PUBLIC ENDPOINT A DEV STACK HAS.
#
# Stripe cannot reach `localhost:5001`, so for as long as this environment had
# no public URL the only way a Plus purchase could complete locally was the
# Stripe CLI relaying events while it happened to be running. This gives each
# machine a real webhook endpoint — a gateway, a zip receiver and a queue —
# and `dev-up.sh` runs the consumer that drains the queue into the local
# backend. `dev-aws-setup.sh` registers the URL with Stripe after this applies
# and writes the queue and secret into dev.env; see the module for the design
# and for why Terraform does not touch the Stripe side.
