# THE ONE THING EVERY DEV STACK SHARES: the Cognito pool.
#
# Every other development resource is per machine — tables, bucket, webhook
# relay — and stays that way. The pool moved out of `envs/dev` in September
# 2026 for one reason: social sign-in. Each provider's console holds a list of
# exact redirect URIs, and a per-machine pool means a per-machine Managed Login
# domain, which means every new machine is a console edit at Google, Meta,
# LinkedIn and Apple before its developer can sign in with any of them. One
# pool is one domain is one URI, registered once:
#
#   https://humbugg-dev.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/idpresponse
#
# What sharing costs: accounts are shared. A `.test` person seeded on one
# machine exists for every machine, with whatever password the LAST seed set —
# `ensure_pool_user` converges the password every run. Per-machine tables still
# hold per-machine data; only the identities are common. And `dev-aws-reset.sh`
# no longer deletes users, because they are not one machine's to delete.
#
# Applied by `dev-aws-setup.sh` on every machine, every run, before the
# per-machine stack. Idempotent, so whoever runs it last is irrelevant — with
# one catch. The social credentials come from the applying machine's
# `dev.env` (a developer gets them from the team's password manager), and
# Terraform cannot tell "this machine has no Google keys" from "remove
# Google". So `dev-aws-setup.sh` refuses to apply this stack while the pool
# holds a provider whose keys the machine lacks; `--skip-shared` uses the
# pool as it is. Nothing here reads SSM for a secret: SSM is where this
# stack PUBLISHES the pool's ids, not a place credentials are kept.
