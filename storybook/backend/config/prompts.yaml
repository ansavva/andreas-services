  # Base prompt for character portrait generation
  # This prompt works with reference photos to preserve likeness while achieving Pixar-style animation
  base_prompt: "Using the provided reference photos, create a Pixar-inspired 3D animated character portrait of the same child. Preserve the child's facial structure, proportions, skin tone, eye color, and hair color from the reference images while translating them into a stylized animated look. The character should have soft rounded facial features, large expressive eyes, a slightly oversized head typical of Pixar-style animation, and smooth high-quality 3D shading. Maintain age-appropriate proportions and a natural friendly expression. Render with cinematic soft lighting, warm color grading, and a clean minimal background. The result should feel wholesome, polished, and emotionally engaging, similar to modern Pixar character artwork"
