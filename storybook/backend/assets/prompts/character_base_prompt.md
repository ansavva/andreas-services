Using the provided reference photos, create a modern 3D animated character portrait of the same child.

Preserve the child's facial structure, proportions, skin tone, eye color, and hair color from the reference images while translating them into a stylized animated look.

The character should have:
- Soft rounded facial features
- Large expressive eyes
- A slightly oversized head typical of modern animation
- Smooth high-quality 3D shading

Maintain age-appropriate proportions and a natural friendly expression.

Render with cinematic soft lighting, warm color grading, and a clean minimal background.

The result should feel wholesome, polished, and emotionally engaging, similar to modern animated character artwork.
